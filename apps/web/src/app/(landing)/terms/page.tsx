        <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">Subscriptions</h3>
        <p>
          Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis
          ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and
          periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set either on a
          monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan
          you select when purchasing a Subscription.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically
          renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or we
          cancel it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through
          your online account management page or by contacting Peacocking
          customer support team.
        </p>
        <p>
          A valid payment method, including credit or debit card, is required to
          process the payment for your Subscription. You shall provide
          Peacocking with accurate and complete billing information including
          full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid
          payment method information. By submitting such payment information,
          you automatically authorize Peacocking to charge all Subscription fees
          incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Peacocking will
          issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually,
          within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to
          the billing period as indicated on the invoice.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">Fee Changes</h3>
        <p>
          Peacocking, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the
          Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change
          will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Peacocking will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any
          change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate
          your Subscription before such change becomes effective.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change
          comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified
          Subscription fee amount.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">Refunds</h3>
        <p>
          Certain refund requests for Subscriptions may be considered by
          Peacocking on a case-by-case basis and granted in sole discretion of
          Peacocking. Incase, your refund request is approved, the refund will
          be processed within 5-7 working days to the original source of
          payment.
